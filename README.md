My note app satisfied all the required functionalities of the lab. You can create a note by typing the title in the bar and click add note. You can edit the title and content of the note. You can move the note by dragging it around. You can delete the note. At the same time, adding, updating, and dragging will sync with the Firebase database so that people on multiple browser pages can interact with the notes.

In short, evrything works and all the requirements are met.
